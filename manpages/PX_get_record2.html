>DESCRIPTION</H2
><P
>This function is similar to PX_get_record(3) but takes two extra
		  parameters. If *deleted is set to 1 the function will consider any
			record in the database, even those which are deleted. If *pxdbinfo is
			not NULL, the function will return some information about the data block
			where the record has been read from. You will have to allocate memory
			for pxdbinfo before calling PX_get_record2.</P
><P
>On return *deleted will be set to 1 if the requested record is
		  deleted or 0 if it is not deleted. The struct pxdatablockinfo_t has
			the following fields:</P

>This function may return records with invalid data, because records
		  are not explizitly marked as deleted, but rather the size of a valid data
			block is modified. A data block is a fixed size area in the file which
			holds a certain number of records. If for some
			reason a data block has newer been completely filled with records, the
			algorithmn anticipates deleted records in this data block, which are not
			there. This often happens with the last data block in a file, which is
			likely to not being fully filled with records.</P
><P
>If you accessing several records, do it in ascending order, because
		  this is the most efficient way.</P
